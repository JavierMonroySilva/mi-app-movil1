Where to put real images for the app

This folder is intended for static images you want to ship with the app.

1) Local assets (recommended for small, static sets)
- Place image files under: `src/assets/images/`
- Reference them from code / services / templates exactly as:
  - `assets/images/my-photo.jpg`
  - Example: in `src/app/services/places.service.ts` set `imageUrl: 'assets/images/my-photo.jpg'`
- During development `ng serve` will serve assets at `/assets/...`.
- When you run `ng build` the assets folder is copied into the `dist/` output and paths remain valid.

Notes and best practices for local assets:
- Keep images reasonably sized. Large images increase bundle size and memory usage.
- Prefer WebP or optimized JPEG/PNG. Use tools like `imagemin`, `sharp`, or online compressors.
- For many images (user uploads) don't ship them as assets — use remote storage.

2) Remote images (CDN / hosted)
- Use full HTTPS URLs for remote images, e.g. `https://example.com/photos/123.jpg`.
- Pros: no larger bundle, can be updated remotely, CDNs give fast delivery and caching.
- Cons: requires network connectivity; consider fallback placeholders for offline.

3) User uploads / Camera capture (mobile)
- Use Capacitor Camera to capture images and Capacitor Filesystem to store locally, or upload to your backend.
- Typical flow:
  - Capture image (Capacitor Camera.getPhoto)
  - Option A: Save to local filesystem and use a path (Platform-specific) — set `imageUrl` to that path
  - Option B: Upload to backend or cloud storage (S3, Firebase Storage) and set `imageUrl` to returned CDN URL
- When showing filesystem images on web, convert to base64 or implement a bridge that serves saved images via a local URL.

4) Template tips (Angular/Ionic)
- Bind image src safely: `<img [src]="place.imageUrl" alt="{{place.place}}" />`
- If you need to sanitize or transform URLs, consider using DomSanitizer for blob/object URLs.

5) Adding an example local image quickly
- Copy a photo into `src/assets/images/new-york.jpg`.
- Update `src/app/services/places.service.ts` to reference `assets/images/new-york.jpg` (an example entry is already present).
- Run `npm run build` or `ng serve` and open the app. The Home and Place Detail pages will show the local image.

6) Optional: lazy-loading / progressive images
- Use small blurred placeholder images first and then swap to high-res when loaded.
- Use intersection observer or Ionic's `ion-img` for lazy loading where supported.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a small image-optimization script (using `sharp`) to produce responsive sizes (small/medium/large) and generate WebP versions.
- Implement a Camera + upload UI that stores user photos in `localStorage`/Filesystem or uploads to a mock backend.

Tell me which option you want next and I will implement it.
